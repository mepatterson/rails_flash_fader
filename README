FlashFader
==========

A simple plug-in that adds a helper method to display flash messages.  The flash message 
is wrapped in a div called "flash-message".  The keyword of the flash is the class of the 
interior div, this provides an agnostic, flexible way to style the messages as you see fit.

Provide the option :fade with the number of seconds to stay on screen, before fade starts.
Requires the Rails <%= javascript_include_tag :all %> if you desire to use the fade effects.

To use simply add the method to your layout.


Examples
========

<%= flash_messages %>  or

<%= flash_messages(:fade => 3) %>
